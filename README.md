## Available Cogs

### GuildWars2

This cog incorporates functions that were mostly not made by me. I have mainly worked on debugging, refining the code, including storage, Discord embeds, and updating some parts written in Python 2.x to be compatible with RedBot V3.

> I'm not sure why, but this cog doesn't seem to like me, and the feeling is mutual. Funny Cog ~ Wyrd
